# Registration Form

## Overview
This project is a simple web-based registration form that demonstrates real-time form validation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The form includes fields for the user's Name, Email, and Password. The JavaScript code performs validation as the user types, ensuring that the form fields meet specific criteria before allowing submission.

## Features
Real-Time Validation: The form validates user input in real time, providing instant feedback if any field is incorrectly filled out.
Error Messages: Displays clear error messages for each field if the validation fails:
Name: Must not be empty.
Email: Must contain a valid email address format.
Password: Must be at least 6 characters long.
Submit Button Control: The submit button is disabled until all fields are correctly validated.
User-Friendly Design: The form is styled to be simple and user-friendly, with error messages displayed clearly next to the relevant fields.

## Technologies Used
HTML5: For structuring the form elements.
CSS3: For styling the form and error messages.
JavaScript: For implementing real-time validation logic.

## Scenarios
Empty Name Field: If the user attempts to submit the form with an empty Name field, an error message will appear, and the submit button will remain disabled.
Invalid Email Format: If the user enters an invalid email format (e.g., user@domain instead of user@domain.com), an error message will appear.
Short Password: If the password is less than 6 characters, an error message will be displayed, and the submit button will be disabled.
